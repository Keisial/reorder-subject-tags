reorder-tags is a tiny program designed to reorder the tags
given in email subjects, to ensure a given order.

Tags are expected to be in the form "[<name> #<id>]" with id being numeric.

For example, reorder-tags foo bar, will ensure that a Subject containing
both [foo #1] and [bar #2], the foo tag will appear befor the bar one.

In case the main tag is not present, a new one is prepended with id 0.
